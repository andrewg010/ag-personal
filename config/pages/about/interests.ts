      copy: `<p>While I'm no master of wine or expert in any way. I'm super passionate about the emerging 'new world' wines that are being produced here in England, especially in my home county of Kent. How better way to celebrate the area I live in than drinking a spot of Kentish bubbles or visiting a local vineyard? Support local!</p>`

      copy: '<p>Even though this is my job, it is also a passion and I devote hours of time to finding out about new tech, expanding my horizons and the skills I can bring to my work and the people I work with. I feel like you can never be knowledgeable enough about the tech surrounding web apps and I strive to constantly improve and learn, refining my skills along the way.</p>'

      copy: '<p>I love to get out into nature. A long walk in the countryside or a hike up a hill is so simple but so pleasing. A pass time of mine! One of my proudest achievements was hiking Scafell Pike (Okay I know it is only a small mountain but I enjoyed it!)</p>'

      name: 'Japan & the Japanese language',
      copy: '<p>I have studied the Japanese language for around five years. This is due to the amazing time I have had travelling in Japan in the past. I love to learn more about the culture, cook the food and expand my ability to speak the language. I can read and write a bit - am I fluent? Not at all, but I\'m proud of the progress I have made learning one of the most difficult languages there is for an English speaker!</p>'

      name: 'Final Fantasy',
      copy: '<p>This video game series is what got me into development in the first place - my very first website was a primitive one based on this game series! Unfortunately it has died a death now but at the time it was top stuff, I promise! I still love the series and will be eagerly playing the ff7 "remake" series.</p>'
